Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin M. Sparenberg and I play a developer on videos.

I'm the Community Evangelist for the [THWACK Community](https://thwack.com) at [SolarWinds](https://www.solarwinds.com).  What's that mean?  I do a little bit of everything - host videos, do admin work on the community, engage with customers, work with vendors, and do a little bit of coding.

My work at SolarWinds is mostly within private repositories which I won't discuss here or anywhere else.  I also have some "outside the office" projects that I try to work on, like building my very first [PowerShell module](https://github.com/kmsigma/vtPowerShell) for interfacing with the Verint/Telligent Community platforms via their API.
